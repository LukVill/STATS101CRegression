Summer '23 STATS101C Regression Project

### Abstract

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that leverages demographic, educational,
and socioeconomic information in order to predict the percentage of voters in different counties
across the United States who voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 US Presidential election. Based on
background information, we originally concluded that income level, race, and education were likely to
be associated with the response variableâ€”the percent of Biden voters in different counties. Previous
studies and research have consistently outlined that income, race, and education are key demographic
patterns that have historically influenced voting patterns. 
For instance, members of a low-income community are likely to vote for more liberal policies that aim to increase
minimum wages and expand affordable healthcare, two platforms that Biden ran on in the 2020
election. On the other hand, wealthier communities,
especially those associated with larger corporations, will likely support Republican candidates
because this party generally advocates for lower taxes and capitalist-friendly policies.
